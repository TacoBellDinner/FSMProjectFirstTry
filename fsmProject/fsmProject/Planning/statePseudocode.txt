generic State class
	member vars:
	pointer to object that had this state


	pure virtual State(), enter(), exit(), and execute() methods

Passive class, inherits from Stats
	Passive() 
		<this is the constructor>
		nothing happens here

	Enter(pointer to a partner ai object)
		<Since we are only coding the transitions, let's just have a message here>
		send to the console a message about how the ai is entering the Passive State

	Exit(pointer to a partner ai object)
		send to the console a message about how the ai is exiting the Passive state

^do pretty much the same thing for all the other classes. When the time comes, we can flesh them out to make
them more unique.
